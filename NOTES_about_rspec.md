The more I work with Rspec the less I understand about its popularity. This is an overly complex DSL that strives to simplify your tests but actually makes them less readable.

pass. and pass_with - how to abort after the first?


something that logically belongs together, such as "run the operation with following input" and "then, the model should look as follows", is split into two parts, just to satisfy the user DSL, making things like transporting state a lot more complex, internally. Again, just to satisfy a verbose test DSL.
